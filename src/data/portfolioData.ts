  about: `ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Alex, a passionate Computer Science student with a deep fascination for cybersecurity.

ðŸŽ“ Currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science with a specialization in Cybersecurity and Information Security. I love the challenge of understanding how systems work and how to protect them from various threats.

ðŸ”’ My journey in cybersecurity started with curiosity about how hackers operate, which led me to learn ethical hacking, penetration testing, and security analysis. I believe that to protect systems effectively, you need to think like an attacker.

ðŸ’» When I'm not diving deep into security research or working on projects, you can find me:
   â€¢ Participating in CTF competitions
   â€¢ Contributing to open-source security tools  
   â€¢ Learning about the latest vulnerabilities and exploits
   â€¢ Building secure applications and systems

ðŸŒŸ My goal is to become a cybersecurity professional who helps organizations stay one step ahead of threats while making the digital world a safer place for everyone.`,
